!!! warning "Users must be added to each individual project they are assigned to"
    Adding a user to the project team grants them access to this specific project, but it does not automatically assign them to ALL projects. Each user must be manually assigned to individual projects by the Program Admin or CVA Manager. Without project assignments, they may see a blank page upon login. Additionally, you can assign each user a specific role within the separate projects they are added to.
