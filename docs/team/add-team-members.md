    How to add team members to your program

### **Adding team members**

In the **Team** page of your program, you can see the list of team members currently added into your program. If you have the permission, you can add a team member to a program.

!!! warning "Permission required"
    Per default, Program Admin and CVA manager can add and delete team members, and assign them a role into a program team. If you would like to add this role to your instance, contact your dedicated account manager or support team via <a href="mailto:support@121.global">this email</a>


- Click on the **Add team member** button on the top right

![Program Team](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/global-121/121-platform/main/e2e/tests/__screenshots__/UserManualScreenshots/userManualScreenshots.spec.ts/ProgramTeam.png)

- In the pop-up window, search for the username of the person you want to add to your programme
- **Assign one or more role(s)**
- Click on the **Add user** button

![Add Team Member](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/global-121/121-platform/main/e2e/tests/__screenshots__/UserManualScreenshots/userManualScreenshots.spec.ts/AddTeamMember.png)

- **Save** your changes. The user will be automatically added into the program team.

!!! question "Can't find the user?"
    If you can't find the user that you want to add to the program, they need to be <a href="../users/add-users.md">added to the 121 platform first</a>

!!! warning "This user is already a team member"
    If you get an error message **"This user is already a team member"**, they have already been added to the team. Do you want to change their roles? Follow the <a href="../team/edit-team-roles-program.md">instructions in this page.</a>
