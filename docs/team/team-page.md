!!! info "This section explains"
    How to manage your program team, add, remove and assign roles to team members.

### Team page in the program

The Program **Team** page is found in each of your active programs, in which you can constitute and manage a different team per program. To enter the **Team** page:

- Select and enter a program
- On the top left, click on Team

![Team Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/global-121/121-platform/main/e2e/tests/__screenshots__/UserManualScreenshots/userManualScreenshots.spec.ts/ProgramTeam.png)

Each team member can have designated roles and permissions to allow them to execute specific tasks within the program. You can read more about roles and permissions on [this page](../users/description-roles.md)

### Managing your Program Team
In the **Team** page of your program, you can create or view the list of team members working into your program. If you have the correct permission assigned, you can:

- [**Add** team members to the program](../team/add-team-members.md)
- [**Assign one or multiple role(s)** to a team member](../team/change-team-roles-program.md)
- [**Change the role** assigned to a team member](../team/change-team-roles-program.md)
- [**Remove team member** from the program team](../team/remove-team-members-program.md)

You can always add, remove and edit members from the team while running your program. Programs status and action history will remain unchanged.

!!! warning "Permission required"
    Per default, Program Admin and CVA manager roles have the permission to add and delete team members, and assign them a role into a program team. If you would like to enable more users to manage the program team members and roles distribution, you can request to add the Team management permission into your instance.
