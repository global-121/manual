### Managing your Project Team

In the **:octicons-people-24: Project Team** page of your project, you can create or view the list of users working into the specific project. If you have the correct permission assigned, you can:

- [**Add** users to the project](../team/add-team-members.md)
- [**Assign one or multiple role(s)** to a user](../team/change-team-roles-program.md)
- [**Change the role** assigned to a user](../team/change-team-roles-program.md)
- [**Remove users** from the project team](../team/remove-team-members-program.md)

You can add, remove, and edit users at any time while managing your project. The project's status and action history will remain unchanged, continuing to track users who made changes, even after they have been removed.

!!! warning "Review **regularly** your Team access"
    We recommend that the **CVA Manager or Program Manager** review the project team on a regular basis to ensure that it is up to date and that only those who are working in the project have access. Any users who no longer work with the project or who have left the organisation should be removed from the project team to ensure data protection.
