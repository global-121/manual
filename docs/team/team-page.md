### Managing your Program Team

In the **Team** page of your project, you can create or view the list of team members working into your project. If you have the correct permission assigned, you can:

- [**Add** team members to the project](../team/add-team-members.md)
- [**Assign one or multiple role(s)** to a team member](../team/change-team-roles-program.md)
- [**Change the role** assigned to a team member](../team/change-team-roles-program.md)
- [**Remove team member** from the project team](../team/remove-team-members-program.md)

You can always add, remove and edit members from the team while running your project. Projects status and action history will remain unchanged.

!!! warning "Review **regularly** your Team access"
    We recommend that the **CVA Manager** review the project team on a regular basis to ensure that it is up to date and that only those who are working in the project have access. Any team members who no longer work with the project or who have left the organisation should be removed from the project team to ensure data protection.
