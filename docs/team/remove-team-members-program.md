In the **Settings** page of your project, under the **Project Team tab**, you can see the list of users currently added into your project. If you have the permission, you can **remove a user from a project**. Team members should be removed from the program team if they no longer work with the program or they have left the organisation to ensure data protection.

!!! Important "Who can perform actions on this page ?"
    Program Admin and CVA Manager can perform actions in this page.
    Additional users may only have View permissions on this page. [Learn more about Users & Roles](../users/users-roles-page.md)

- Enter the desired project and **go to :material-cog-outline: Settings** page,
- Select the **Project Team** tab,

!!! info "User logins remain active"

    After a user’s permissions are revoked from a project, their account remains active. This means the user can still log in to the platform and access any other projects where they still have assigned roles.
    
    If you wish to fully revoke a user’s account and disable their login access to the platform, please contact our support team to permanently remove their access.

### A user was removed by mistake?

Do not worry! The action history and logs remain unchanged. If you have the permission, you can add the user back to the team. If not, contact your 121 Program Admin or CVA manager, or our support team to help you.

!!! info "add users to a project"
    You can follow these instructions to [add users to a project on this page.](./add-team-members.md).
