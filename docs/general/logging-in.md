### Single Sign-On (SSO)

If Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled in your organizationâ€™s system, users will be required to log in using their **Microsoft account email address**. This will automatically log them into the 121 platform. To access SSO, your organization must have enabled it, and your email must be part of the registry.

!!! question "Haven't received your login credentials?"
    You can ask your Organisational Admin to verify if an invitation was sent to your email and if your user account was created in the instance within the [**Users** page.](../users/users-roles-page.md).

    If your account has not been set up yet, the Organisational Admin can send you an invitation by [following the instructions on the Add Users page.](../users/add-users.md)
