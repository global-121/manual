    How to change your instance language


### Change the language

You can change the language of the 121 Platform for yourself by clicking on the language switcher. The language will be changed for your account only. English, French, Spanish, Dutch and Arabic languages are available. If you use Arabic per default, the language switcher is on the left.

Change the language before logging in to the 121 Platform:

At login, click on the current language in the top right corner of the login section. Select your preferred language.
