### Adding new users in 121

This is currently not possible to create user from your 121 instance. Additional users can be created and added upon request by the 121 support team. You can contact your dedicated Account Manager or our support team via <a href="mailto:support@121.global">this email</a> by sending the following details : 

- Name of the user
- User email address
- Requested role and permissions

Upon receipt, our team will share the credentials to the new user(s) to the indicated email address. The new users will be listed into the users page. You will then be able to add the new user into a team program and assign a role.
