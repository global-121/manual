### Adding new users in 121

Currently, additional users can be added upon request by the 121 Admin user. You can [contact](mailto:support@121.global) your dedicated Account Manager or our 121 support team by sending the following details : 

- Name of the user
- User address email
- Upon receipt, our team will share the credentials to the Admin user(s) of your instance. The new users will be listed into the Users page. You will then be able to add the new user into a team program and assign a role.
