- Add team members into the program, [here](./add-team-members)
- Assign one or multiple role(s) to a team member, [here](./edit-team-roles-program)
- Change the role assigned to a team member, [here](./edit-team-roles-program.md)

You can always add, remove and edit members from the program team while running your program. Programs status and action history will remain unchanged.

If you would like to enable more users to manage the program team members and roles distribution, you can request to add the Team management role into your instance.
