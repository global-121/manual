### Standard 121 user roles

No single user can take all actions in the 121 platform. The 121 platform follows **role-based segregation of duties**, which improves task **accountability**. For example, users with a CVA profile will not be able to make payments but are able to make updates to beneficiary data. Users with a finance profile can make payments, but are not able to update beneficiariesâ€™ personal information. The following standard roles are configured in the 121 platform.

| Type                | Description                                                          |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Organisational Admin**| System Administrator, overseeing user access on the platform and managing project with an overall view of project progress.|
| **CVA Officer**     | Officer for Cash and Voucher Assistance.                              |
| **CVA Manager**     | Manager for Cash and Voucher Assistance.                              |
| **Finance Officer** | Officer for Finance operations and audit.                             |
| **Finance Manager** | Manager for Finance operations, payment instructions.                 |
| **View**            | Portal Users who are allowed to view only and cannot perform actions. |
