### **Standard 121 user roles**

No single user can take all actions in the 121 platform. The 121 platform follows **role-based segregation of duties**, which improves task **accountability**. For example, users with a CVA profile will not be able to make payments but are able to make updates to beneficiary data. Users with a finance profile can make payments, but are not able to update beneficiariesâ€™ personal information. The following standard roles are configured in the 121 platform.
