### Adding new users in 121

It is currently not possible to create new users from your 121 instance. Additional users can be created and added upon request by the 121 support team. You can contact your dedicated Account Manager or our support team on <support@121.global> by sending the following details:

- **Name** of the user
- User **email address**
- Requested **roles and permissions**. *Check available roles on [this page.](../users/description-roles.md)*

Upon receipt, our team will create the new user(s) and an email will be sent to the new user(s) at the indicated email address. The new users will be added into the users overview of your instance. You will then be able to add them into a team program and assign a role.
