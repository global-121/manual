To grant login credentials and access to a new user on the 121 platform, you must add them as a 121 user.

!!! Important "Who can perform actions on this page ?"
    Program Admin can view and perform actions in this page.

## Adding new users in 121

On the left of your screen, open the **:material-menu: menu** and select **Users**, ![Menu](../assets/img/UserMenu.png)

- On the top right of the **Users Page**, click **:material-plus: Add new users**,
- Add the Name(s) of the users and email address,
- **Submit**.

![Insert User Email](../assets/img/AddingNewUser.png)

**An email will be automatically sent to the specified address. Ensure the email is correctly entered before sending the access link. The user will receive their credentials and a link to access the 121 platform through this email.**

!!! warning "Add users to a project"
    Creating and adding a new user on the Users page grants them access to the 121 platform. However, this does not automatically assign them to any projects. As a result, they may see a blank page upon their first login unless they have already been added to a project.

    Each user must be manually added to the specific projects they are assigned to. You can assign them a specific role within the project. Follow the instructions on [this page to add team members to a project.](../team/add-team-members.md)

- Confirm the action.
