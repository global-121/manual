### Adding new users in 121

This is currently not possible to create user from your 121 instance. Additional users can be created and added upon request by the 121 support team. You can contact your dedicated Account Manager or our support team on <a href="mailto:support@121.global">support@121.global</a> by sending the following details : 

- **Name** of the user
- User **email address**
- Requested **roles and permissions**. *Check available roles on [this page.](../users/description-roles.md)*

Upon receipt, our team will share the credentials to the new user(s) at the indicated email address. The new users will be listed into the users overview of your instance. You will then be able to add them into a team program and assign a role.
