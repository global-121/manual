1. Navigate to the **Registrations** page at the top. You should see the registrations table.
2. There are two ways of finding a registration
    - Quick search
    - Column filtering

## Quick search

To use quick search, you click the search icon (:octicons-search-16:) on the top right corner of the table section. Now you can quickly search through most columns.

!!! info
    Quick search works for most, but **not** all columns. So if you don't find what you are looking for, please use column filtering

## Column filtering

You can apply a filter to each column that is visible in the table by clicking on the filter icon (:material-filter-outline:) next to each column header.

!!! info
    If you want to show/hide certain columns please see [Changing default columns](../pa-table/#changing-default-columns)
