To protect beneficiary data, it is essential to manage who in your organization has access to the 121 system.

### Checking Current Access

1. After logging in and clicking on the program, click on the **Team** tab at the top right.
2. Review the list of accounts in the table that appears:
3. Check the **Name** and **Email** columns:
    - Are there people in the list who should no longer have access? Then contact the Red Cross so we can remove them.
    - Would you like to add a new person? If so, please also contact the Red Cross and we will do it for you.

    Please check this list often, like every two weeks, to keep the beneficiary data safe. If someone leaves your organization, tell the Red Cross directly so we can close their 121 account.
