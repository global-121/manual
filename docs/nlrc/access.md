To protect beneficiary data, it is essential to manage who in your organization has access to the 121 system.

### Checking Current Access

1. After logging in and clicking on the program, click on the **Team** tab at the top right.
2. Review the list of accounts in the table that appears:
3. Cross-check the **Name** and **Email** columns:
    - Are there people among them who should no longer have access? Then contact the Red Cross so we can remove them.
    - Would you like to add a new person? If so, please also contact the Red Cross and we will do it for you.

!!! danger "Regular checks needed"
    To ensure that beneficiaries' data remains as secure as possible, we would ask you to check this list regularly (e.g. once every fortnight).
    Does someone stop working for your organization? Please inform the Red Cross as well, so that we can deactivate the 121 account.
