2. In the table, click on the filter icon (:material-filter-outline:) next to the 'Registration Status' column.
3. Click on "Choose options"
4. From the list of options, ensure only **Registered** is checked, the filter is automatically applied.
5. For each registration in the resulting list you either:
    - **Validate**: Validate registrations from people you know and have registered yourself
    - **Decline**: If you do not recognize a person's details, you can reject the registration

    2. Right-click the registration that you want to apply an action on, and select the corresponding action from the menu that appears.
