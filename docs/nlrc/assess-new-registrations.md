Assessing new registrations is an important task. As a partner, you need to make sure that only valid registrations are approved. This helps keep our system safe. Follow these steps to check new registrations:

1. Go to the **Registrations** page at the top. You will see the registrations table.
2. In the table, click the filter icon (:material-filter-outline:) next to the 'Registration Status' column.
3. Click "Choose options".
4. From the list, make sure only **Registered** is checked. The filter will apply automatically.
5. For each registration in the list, you can:
    - **Validate**: Approve registrations from people you know and have registered yourself.
    - **Decline**: Reject registrations if you do not recognize the person's details.
6. You can validate or decline in two ways:
    1. Select all the registrations you want to validate or decline, then click the corresponding button on top of the table.
    2. Right-click the registration you want to validate or decline, and choose the action from the menu.
7. Confirm your action in the popup that appears.
