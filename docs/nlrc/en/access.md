To keep data secure, it's important to check who has access to the 121 platform.

## Check Current Access

1. Log in and open the program
2. Click the Team tab at the top right
3. View the list of names and emails

Actions:

- Remove someone? Contact the Red Cross
- Add someone? Request it via the Red Cross
- Check regularly: Review the list at least every two weeks. If someone leaves, report it immediately to the Red Cross

    Please check this list often, like every two weeks, to keep the beneficiary data safe. If someone leaves your organization, tell the Red Cross directly so we can close their 121 account.
