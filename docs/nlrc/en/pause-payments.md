As long as a beneficiary has status 'Included', they will automatically receive a new payment every week. If necessary, you can temporarily pause payments. This can be done in the following way:

1. Locate the beneficiary or beneficiaries:
   - Follow [these](./filter-registrations.md) steps to find the specific beneficiary.
2. Select the beneficiary/beneficiaries that you want to temporarily pause the assistance for.
3. Click **Pause**
4. In the popup, enable *"Send a message to registration(s)"*: an automatic message will be sent to the beneficiary in their preferred language
5. Then confirm the action.
6. The beneficiary will temporarily not receive assistance.

You can also achieve the same result by right-clicking the beneficiary in the table and clicking 'Pause'.
