Click on Registrations at the top of the page to view the registration table.

There are two ways to find a registration:

- Quick Search
- Column Filtering

## Quick Search

1. Click the search icon (:octicons-search-16:) in the top right of the table.
2. Enter a search term, such as a first or last name or phone number.

The person will appear.

!!! info
    Quick search works for most, but not all columns. If you can't find what you're looking for, use column filtering.

## Column Filtering

You can filter any column by clicking the filter icon (:material-filter-outline:) next to the column header.

To show or hide certain columns, click the settings icon (:material-cog-outline:) to adjust the default columns.

Example: You can search by registration number, full name, registration status, FSP, phone number, and registration date.

FSP (type of assistance):

- Albert Heijn (digital)
- Albert Heijn (printed)
- Visa card (periodically)
- Occasionally (physical)
