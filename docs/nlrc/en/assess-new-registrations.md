It's important to review new registrations. Only validate registrations of people registered by you or your colleagues. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the 'Registrations' page.
2. Click the filter icon (:material-filter-outline:) next to 'Registration Status'.
3. Click 'Choose options' and select only 'New'. The filter is applied automatically.

For each registration, you can:

- **Validate:** If you know and registered the person
- **Decline:** If you don't recognize the data

You can do this in two ways:

- Select multiple registrations using the checkboxes on the left and click validate or decline
- Right-click on a registration and choose an action
- Confirm your choice in the pop-up

!!! Danger "Validating registrations"
    Only validate registrations for people you know and have registered yourself. Decline registrations with unrecognized details.
