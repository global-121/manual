    The offline verification process requires a good coordination together with our support team and your field team. To ensure the process runs smoothly, we will elaborate a clear communication plan together with your local team.

## Before Offline Verification

The **first step** is to prepare **Kobo for offline verification**. It includes the following steps:

### Get the Verification Form Ready and Approved

Before starting verification, you need to **tell the 121 account manager** or support team what information you need to check during verification.

The 121 support team will reach out to you to **determine the requirements for the offline verification**. Then, our support team will setup a Kobo form and share with you so that you can approve the form.

### Upload 121 Data & Get ready for training

Once the **form is approved**, the 121 support team will **upload all the verification data** into Kobo. After that the 121 support team will do a training of trainers session, so that you can train your volunteers or enumerators to use the form.

### Final Checks

Once you have trained your volunteers, you are almost ready to start field verification. **Before you start**, there are two crucial steps to complete:
