### Read the Program Details metrics

The **Program Details metrics** translates your program requirements. The details provide the main information about the duration and location of your program, budget, targeted People Affected, cash aid delivery and distribution frequencies. Each of your active programs may show different metrics in the table below.

### Change the Program Details metrics

When setting up your instance, our team will request you to share your **program details**. These metrics can be adjusted depending on your program requirements, and along the duration of the program. For instance, the dates, frequency and duration can sometimes change while your program is running.

!!! Warning "Updating your metrics"
Currently it is not possible to perform any actions in the Program Design or change these metrics yourself. Please [contact the 121 support team](mailto:support@121.global) to help you with this.
