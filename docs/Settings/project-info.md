## Optional project settings

In the **Basic Information** table, you can either enable the **Use of validation** (1) or **Use scope in the project** (2).

### 1. Use "validation" in this project

An offline validation form can be linked to your project. This form is developed in collaboration with your IM team and our support team. It can be used after registration is completed—for example, for random sampling validation or in programs where registrations must be verified before specific actions, such as SIM card distribution or identity confirmation during QR code distribution.

The validation form consists of a set of verification questions that need to be configured according to your project’s requirements.

!!! warning "Setting up the validation form"

    **Enabling this feature does not automatically create the validation form**. To set it up, please contact our support team. We recommend that the form be configured at least seven working days before field deployment.

### 2. Use Scope in the project

The **Scope** defines the specific branch or area a user is associated with. For example, in the Netherlands, the Red Cross operates multiple local branches by region. Each of these branches has its own scope within the 121 Platform. This ensures that users from a particular branch can only access data or registrations related to their own branch.

If you’d like to set up scopes to limit data access based on local branches or regions, our support team can assist you with the setup.

To do so, you’ll need to provide a list of branches or areas you want to include. This list will be integrated into your registration form to ensure that all data is correctly linked to the appropriate scope. Once configured, you’ll be able to assign scopes to individual users on the [project team page.](../team/add-team-members.md)
