The **Registrations** page lets you review and, if necessary, update the registered Beneficiaries' details before including them in the project to start receiving cash assistance. Note that Beneficiaries are referred to as Registrations (reg) in the 121 Platform.

!!! Important "Who can perform actions on this page ?"

    Additional users may only have View permissions on this page. [Learn more about Users & Roles](../users/users-roles-page.md)


### Overview of registered beneficiaries

Oversee all new **registrations**. The initial status for the beneficiaries is shown as **Registered** and will remain as it until the CVA manager or officer **include** (included) into, or **decline** (declined) the PA from the project.

### Import a registration list

List of registered beneficiaries in the 121 Platform can be imported in two ways:

- **Automatically**, by integrating your registrations with your KOBO form, or equivalent data collection form, with the 121 Platform. This will directly upload your registrations. Learn more on the [automatic import of registration page](../registration/registration-automatic-import-kobo.md)
- **Manually**, by importing a registration list from an excel file (.CSV format). Learn more on the [registration import list page](../registration/registration-import-list.md)

### Review and update the status of registered beneficiaries

Your SOPs may include reviewing the beneficiaries' details before validating and including the beneficiary in the project.
Follow the instructions on how to:

- [Review, edit and validate details in beneficiary's profiles](../registration/registration-validate-pa.md)
- [Deduplicate your registration list in 121 platform](../registration/registration-deduplication.md)
- [Include a beneficiary in a project](../registration/inclusion-in-program.md)
- [Decline a beneficiary from a project](../registration/registration-reject-pa.md)
- [Pause a beneficiary in a project](../payment/pause-payment-pa.md)
- [End a beneficiary participation in a project](../payment/end-payments.md)

### Deduplicate registration

Check for duplicates in the registration list before including the People Affected in your project. This validation process prevents double payments and reduces fraud risks so we strongly recommend including deduplication in your validation process.

Follow the instructions on the [Deduplication page](../registration/registration-deduplication.md)
