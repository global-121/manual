1. Go to the **Registrations** page at the top. You will see the registrations table.
2. There are two ways to find a registration:
    - Quick search
    - Column filtering

## Quick search

To use quick search, click the search icon (:octicons-search-16:) in the top-right corner of the table. You can now search through most columns.

!!! info
    Quick search works for most, but **not** all columns. If you cannot find what you need, use column filtering.

## Column filtering

You can filter each column in the table by clicking the filter icon (:material-filter-outline:) next to the column header.

!!! info
    To show or hide certain columns, see [Changing default columns](../pa-table/#changing-default-columns).
