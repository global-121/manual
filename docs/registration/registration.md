    How to use the Registration page

The registration page lets you review and, if necessary, update the registered beneficiaries details before including them in the program to start receiving cash assistance.
Note that Beneficiaries are referred to as People Affected (PA) in the 121 Platform.

![Registration and Validation page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/global-121/121-platform/main/e2e/tests/__screenshots__/UserManualScreenshots/userManualScreenshots.spec.ts/RegistrationPageOverview.png)

### Overview of registered PA

Oversee all registered People Affected (beneficiaries). The initial status for the PAs is shown as "Registered" and will remain as it until the CVA manager / officer include (validated) into, or reject (rejected) the PA from the program.

Once your validation process is completed, the Registration page will show an [empty table.](../registration/registration-list-empty.md)

### Import a registration list

Registration of PAs in the 121 Platform can be done in two ways:

- **Automatically**, by integrating your KOBO form or equivalent registration form with the 121 Platform to directly upload your registrations. Learn more on the [automatic import of registration page](../registration/registration-automatic-import-kobo.md)
- **Manually**, by importing a registration list from an excel file (.CSV format). Learn more on the [registration import list page](../registration/registration-import-list.md)


### Review and Process registered PA's details

Your valiation process may include reviewing the beneficiaries' details before validating and including the beneficiary in the program to start receiving cash assistance.
Follow the instructions on how to:

- [Review and edit data in PA profile](../registration/registration-deduplication.md)
- [Include a PA in a program](../registration/registration-validate-pa.md)
- [Reject a PA from a program](../registration/registration-reject-pa.md)


### Deduplicate registration

Check for duplicates in the registration list before including the People Affected in your program. This validation process prevents double payments and reduces fraud risks so we strongly recommend including deduplication in your validation process.

Follow the instructions on the [Deduplication page](../registration/registration-deduplication.md)
