### Empty list

Do you see an empty list when you are in the registrations page? The registration table can be empty for a few reasons :

- No new registrations have been uploaded since last validation round. The table will show "No data"
- No automatic upload has been made from the KOBO form or any alternative registration app yet. This is usually caused by a lack of internet connection. To begin importing new registrations, connect the device with the KOBO form open to an internet network.
- Filters are applied to the list. Make sure the filter search barre is empty, on the top of the table .

!!! warning "Blank page"
    In case the page is fully blank and does not show the registration table, there may be a technical issue with the link connecting with your KOBO form.
    Please contact your dedicated Account Manager or our [support team](mailto:support@121.global) to help fixing the issue.

## Data sent from KOBO to 121 Platform

Our team will link all questions added to your KOBO to 121 Platform, the data will be shown in the registration profile. This may include questions - answers, digits, numbers, etc.

There is no need to follow any templates as this adaptable in 121 Platform. However, you may consider whether all the data in your KOBO form is relevant to the inclusion evaluation of your beneficiaries into the program. Our Cash IM Team may advice some changes, when needed, to optimize the data reported in 121 Platform, ease the inclusion score calculation and program reporting.

!!! Info "Editing the data"
    Please note that the connection between KOBO and the 121 Platform is a one-way upload. This means that data is not synchronized between the two systems. Any changes made in KOBO after the data has been uploaded to the 121 Platform will not be reflected in the Platform. You must make edits directly in the 121 Platform.

    For example, if Beneficiary A is registered in KOBO and you upload the data to the 121 Platform at the end of the day, you might later notice that question 4 was not answered by Beneficiary A. In this case, you will need to find Beneficiary A's profile in the 121 Platform to make the necessary edits. Changes made instead in KOBO Beneficiary A's form after the initial upload will not be updated in the 121 Platform.
