The Validation stage is optional, depending on the SOPs you follow for your CVA program. Validation can be used to mark People Affected whose information has been checked and verified, before taking the step to include them in the program. By validating PAs you update their status in the 121 Platform from Registered to Validated, which allows you to keep track of the PAs whose information has been checked.

### Validation of People Affected into the program

The People Affected table shows all of the registered households for your program. Their initial status should be **Registered**.

- To mark the People Affected as validated click on **Choose Action : Mark as Validated**.
- When clicking, a tick box :material-checkbox-blank-outline: appears on the left of the PA name column.
  - Make an **individual selection** by clicking on the :material-checkbox-outline: on the PA line;
  - Or a **bulk selection** by clicking on the :material-checkbox-multiple-marked-outline: on the upper line **Select**
- A pop-up appears to confirm your action **You are about to Mark as Validated for X People Affected.**
- Click on OK. A message indicates the completion of the action.
- PA status is now updated to **Validated**.

### Editing PAs details

Due to misspelling or double entry, you may need to edit details in the PA profile before validation and inclusion into the program.

- **Enter the PA profile** by clicking on the **PA#** hyperlink on the left side.
- Once in the PA profile overview, click on **Show All**
- A pop-up appears with the PAs details and data collected with the registration form.
- Search for the field to edit.
- Type in the new value and click **Save**
- A pop-up **Reason for update** request to fill in the reason for this change.
- Add a reason, then **Save**
