    Steps validate and move People Affected into the inclusion phase of your program

The Validation stage is optional, depending on the SOPs you follow for your CVA program. Validation can be used to mark People Affected whose information has been checked and verified, before taking the step to include them in the program. By validating PAs you update their status in the 121 Platform from Registered to Validated, which allows you to keep track of the PAs whose information has been checked. 

### **Validation of People Affected into the program**

The People Affected table shows all of the registered households for your program. Their initial status should be **Registered**. 

- To mark the People Affected as validated click on **Choose Action : Mark as Validated**.
- When clicking, a tick box :material-checkbox-blank-outline: appears on the left of the PA name column.
    - Make an individual selection by clicking on the :material-checkbox-outline: on the PA line; 
    - Or a bulk selection by clicking on the :material-checkbox-multiple-marked-outline: on the upper line **Select**
- A pop-up appears to confirm your action **You are about to Mark as Validated for X People Affected.**
- Click on OK. A message indicates the completion of the action.
- PA status is now updated to **Validated**.

### **Validation and deduplication process**

Your validation process may include :

- Deduplication of People Affected in your registration list. Follow the instructions [on the deduplication page](../registration/registration-deduplication.md)
- Verifying and editing People Affected details. Follow the instructions on the People Affected details page.
