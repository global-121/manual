If you are not collecting registrations with a Kobo form or equivalent, which automatically transfers the registrations into the 121 Platform, a registration list can be manually imported from an excel file (.csv format).

!!! Important "Who can perform actions in this page?"
    CVA Manager and CVA Officer roles can perform actions in the Registrations page.  
    Additional users may be granted only **View** permission on this page. [Learn more about Users & Roles](../users/users-roles-page.md)

If you want to import your registration list using an excel file (.csv format), you first need to make sure that this file matches the format accepted by 121. To match these, first download the .csv template file from the 121 Platform, then you can upload your matching file with the registration information to 121.

*For import of new registrations via KOBO Toolbox App, Follow the instructions on [this page](../registration/registration-automatic-import-kobo.md). Want to integrate your KOBO form or alternative registration App with the 121 Platform ? Please, contact our team.*

### Download the template registration file

The template is **automatically generated in the 121 Platform**, based on the program registration form.
For example, the program registration form may include selection criteria such as name, phone number, amount of household members, province and IBAN number. The template will automatically include these labels, matching the registration form questions. Below, you can find an example of a template based on a KOBO registration form.

- **Select the Program** you will be uploading registrations for.
- Go to the **Registrations** page. ![Registration Page](../assets/img/RegistrationsPageImport.png)
- Click on the **Import Registrations** button on the left side of the screen. ![Import Registration pop-up](../assets/img/ImportRegistrationTemplate.png)
- Select **Download template CSV-file**.
- Open the downloaded CSV template in Excel.
- Copy the registration data you have in excel into the .csv file to match this format, making sure each piece of information goes into the correct column with the right labels.

### Import a registration list

- Go back to the **registrations** page of your **selected Project**, which you will be uploading registrations for.
- Click on the **Import Registrations** button on the right side of the screen.
- Click to chose the CSV file from your computer that you have **already matched to the format required by 121**. ![Import Registration pop-up](../assets/img/ImportRegistrationTemplate.png)
- After uploading the file, click **Import File** to apply the action.
- Another pop up will appear with confirmation that the import was successful. *Please note this can take some time depending on the number of registrations that are being uploaded.*
