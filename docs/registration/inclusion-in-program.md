The Inclusion stage is a necessary step to move a PA from the registration phase to the payment phase.

Depending on the SOPs you follow for your CVA program, Validation can be used to mark People Affected whose information has been checked and verified, before taking the step to include them in the program. You can follow the steps to validate the PA details on this [page](./registration-validate-pa.md/)

### Inclusion of People Affected into the program

The People Affected table shows all of the registered households for your program. Their initial status should be **Registered**. Or, if you SOPs include a validation step, the status may show **Validated**

- To mark the People Affected as included click on **Choose Action : Include in program**.
- When clicking, a tick box :material-checkbox-blank-outline: appears on the left of the PA name column.
  - Make an **individual selection** by clicking on the :material-checkbox-outline: on the PA line;
  - Or a **bulk selection** by clicking on the :material-checkbox-multiple-marked-outline: on the upper line **Select**
- A pop-up appears to confirm your action **You are about to Include in program for X People Affected.**
- Click on OK. A message indicates the completion of the action.
- Refresh the page. PA status is now updated to **Included**.

    The SOPs may include a deduplication process of the registered PAs before initiating the inclusion phase. Follow the instructions to [check your registration list and deduplicate PA before moving the list to the inclusion phase](./registration-deduplication.md).
