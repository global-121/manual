The Inclusion stage is a necessary step to move a list of beneficiaries from the registration phase to the payment phase.

Based on the SOPs you follow for your CVA project, **Validation** can be used to identify beneficiaries whose information has been verified, either prior to including them in the program or for sharing the verified list with a committee for approval. You can follow the steps to validate the PA details on the [Validation page](./registration-validate-pa.md/)

!!! Important "Who can perform actions in this page?"
    CVA Manager and CVA Officer roles can perform actions in the Registrations page.  
    Additional users may be granted only **View** permission on this page. [Learn more about Users & Roles](../users/users-roles-page.md)

### Inclusion of Beneficiaries into the program

The **Registrations table** shows all of the registered households or beneficiaries for your project. Their initial status should be **Registered**. Or, if you SOPs include a validation step, the status may show **Validated**.

To mark the Beneficiaries as **included**:

- go to the **Registrations Page**;
- Filter the list of beneficiaries on **status**, select **Registered** and **Apply**. *this action is to make sure you select only **registered** status.* ![Filter Status Register](assets/img/RegisteredStatusFilter.png)
- You can select one beneficiary or the entire registration list:
    - Make an **individual selection** by clicking on the :material-checkbox-outline: on the PA line;
    - Or a **bulk selection** by clicking on the :material-checkbox-multiple-marked-outline: on the upper line **Select**;
- On the top of the table, click **:octicons-check-16: Include** button;
- A pop-up appears to confirm your action **You're about to include X registrations. This means that they can be included in payments.**
- Click on **Approve**. A message indicates the completion of the action;
- The status is now updated to **Included**.

!!! info "Deduplication process"
    The SOPs may include a deduplication process of the registered beneficiaries before initiating the inclusion phase. Follow the instructions to [check your registration list and deduplicate PA before moving the list to the inclusion phase](./registration-deduplication.md).

### Decline People Affected from the program

You may have to **decline** a certain number of **registered beneficiaries** from your program.
You can follow the instructions on this [page](./registration-reject-pa.md)

### Send a message to the beneficiaries

There is an option to send a message to beneficiaries for each action you perform in the instance, such as Including, Declining, or Sending payments to beneficiaries. If you would like to communicate project progress to the registered beneficiaries, you can toggle the button to **Send a message to registrations** and enable messaging through the 121 Platform.

To enable messaging services, you must create a Twilio account and ensure there are sufficient messaging credits. Contact our team to set this up.
