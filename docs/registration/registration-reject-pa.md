Not everyone registered for your project may be eligible to be included in the project, or there may be cases of duplicate registrations. In these cases you may need to decline Beneficiaries from the project.

You use this **Registrations** Page and dropdown menu to choose the appropriate next actions : validating, rejecting or editing registration of PA, move the beneficiaries into inclusion phase.

!!! Important "Who can perform actions on this page ?"
    Organisational Admin, CVA Officer and CVA Manager can perform actions.  
    Additional users may only have View permissions on this page. [Learn more about Users & Roles](../users/users-roles-page.md)

### Decline registrations from the project

The **Registrations table** shows you all of the registered households or beneficiaries for your project. Their status should be **Registered**.

To mark the Beneficiaries as **declined**:

- Go to the **Registrations Page**;
- Filter the list of beneficiaries on **status**, select **Registered** and **Apply**. *this action is to make sure you select only **registered** status.* ![Filter Status Register](../assets/img/RegisteredStatusFilter.png)
- You can select one beneficiary or the entire registration list:
    - Make an **individual selection** by clicking on the :material-checkbox-outline: on the registration line;
    - Or a **bulk selection** by clicking on the :material-checkbox-multiple-marked-outline: on the upper line **Select**
- On the top of the table, click **:fontawesome-solid-ban: Decline** button;
- A pop-up appears to confirm your action **You're about to decline X registrations. This means that they will not be included in payments.**
- Click on **Approve**. A message indicates the completion of the action.

Declined registrations remain listed in the Registrations page with the status **Declined**. Filter the list by status to have an overview of all declined beneficiaries in this project.

**If you make a mistake and decline beneficiaries who should be included in the program, don't worry! You can update this by following the [instructions to Include registrations in the project.](../inclusion-in-program.md)**

### Send a message to the beneficiaries

There is an option to send a message to beneficiaries for each action you perform in the instance, such as Including, Declining, or Sending payments to beneficiaries. If you would like to communicate project progress to the registered beneficiaries, you can toggle the button to **Send a message to registrations** and enable messaging through the 121 Platform.

To enable messaging services, you must create a Twilio account and ensure there are sufficient messaging credits. Contact our team to set this up.
