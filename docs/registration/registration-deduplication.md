Below, you will find the steps to deduplicate double entries or beneficiaries registered multiple times in the same project registration list. The deduplication is currently a semi-automated process, that first requires users to check the entries in the excel file downloaded and then update the registrations within the 121 Platform.

### Export the duplication report

- Go to **Registrations** Page,
- On the top right, click on the **Export** button,![Export Button Deduplication](../assets/img/ExportbuttonRegistrations.png)
- Open the drop down and select the export **Duplicate Registrations**,
- The file will be downloaded on your device in the **download folder** as an excel file.

**Duplicates are identified based on specific unique criteria** such as phone number or ID number. This criteria is flexible and can be chosen by the organisation and changed depending on the program requirements. Request our team to adjust the criteria based on your project.

### Filter the duplicated Registrations

In the excel file:
    - Following your organization's SOPs, all duplicated entries will be listed based on the unique criteria (ID number, phone number or required criteria),
    - In the column **duplicateWithIds**, you will find the matching **Reg. # number**,
    - You can now read the value that is duplicated in the **Reg. # profiles**,
    - In the excel, you can mark if this value shall be edited or the beneficiary's profile deleted depending on the reason identified.

Based on the project requirements, you may decide to edit the value in case this was an entry error. Or, you can decline the registration, in case this was a double entry.

## Update the list of registrations

Once you have identified the duplication list, and decided to either edit or decline the registrations, you can update the registration list in the 121 platform.
You can perform 2 actions in the **Registrations** page:
    - **Edit the value directly in the registration profile**
    - **Decline the registration**, in case this is a double entry for the same beneficiary.

Below, the solution based on either of these 2 options:

---

## Edit the value in the registration profile

- Search for the registration number by filtering the **Reg. # column** ![Filter Registration Number](../assets/img/FilterRegistrationNumber.png)
- Open the profile clicking on **Reg. #** on the left side. You will now see the registration overview,
- Click the tab **Personal Information** and search for the value to be edited,
- **Edit** the value. Click on **Save** and give a reason,
- The new value is now saved.

## Decline the PA profile

- Search for the registration number by filtering the **Reg. # column** ![Filter Registration Number](../assets/img/FilterRegistrationNumber.png)
- Once you have found the registration, **tick the box** on the left side of the registration. **Make sure you only select the individual**, and do not select in bulk.
- On the top of the table, click on the **Decline** button,
- **Approve** the action. *Confirm only if you are sure to decline this registration, otherwise cancel.*

Did you accidentally mark a registration as declined? No worries, this is a reversible action. You can always change the status back to **Included**.

!!! Info "TIP: do not save old duplicate excel record"
    To prevent mistakes and keep personal data secure, excel files should be deleted from your computer once your database is cleaned and updated in 121 platform. This way, you will always have your latest updated list of registered beneficiaries in 121.
