Below, you will find the steps to deduplicate double entries or beneficiaries registered multiple times in the same registration list.

!!! Important "Who can perform actions on this page ?"
    Program Admin, CVA Officer and CVA Manager can perform actions.  
    Additional users may only have View permissions on this page. [Learn more about Users & Roles](../users/users-roles-page.md)

## View and Filter the duplicates

- Go to **Registrations** Page,
- On the top right of the table, click on the **:material-image-filter-vintage: manage table** icon and select the **Duplicate** column.
- **Apply**. The column will show either **Unique** or **Duplicate**

!!! Info "TIP: Unique vs. Duplicate"
    **Unique** means that there is no double entry found for this registration.

    **Duplicate** means that a registration has been entered multiple times with a matching value.

**Duplicates are identified based on specific unique criteria** and are shown as **Matching Fields** in the platform, such as first and last names, phone number or ID number. This criteria can be chosen by the organisation depending on the program requirements. Request our team to adjust the criteria based on your project.

- To filter and shortlist the Duplicated registrations, click on the **filter icon :material-filter-outline:** on the **Duplicate Column** and select **Duplicate**
- The table displays the list of duplicates to be verified.

## Read the duplicate value

Following your organization's SOPs, all duplicated entries will be listed based on the unique criteria (ID number, phone number or required criteria). You can verify the fields matching different registrations and either decline, ignore or include the registrations as follows:

- In the table, **click** on the **Reg. #** to open the profile,
- On top of the profile page, you can read **Matchingfields:** followed with the matching value. *This is the value that has been entered multiple times and that requires attention*.
- Click on the **Open new window** icon to check both profiles, side by side.

## Update the list of registrations

Once you have identified the duplication list, and decided to either edit or decline the registrations, you can update the registration list in the 121 platform.
You can perform 3 actions in the **Registrations** page:

- **Edit the value directly in the registration profile**
- **Decline the registration**, in case this is a double entry for the same beneficiary.
- **Validate** registrations with the same registered fields.

Below, the solution based on either of these 3 options:

---

### Edit the value in the registration profile

- Open the profile clicking on **Reg. #** on the left side. You will now see the registration overview,
- Click the tab **Personal Information**, then **Edit** button and search for the value to be edited, ![Edit Value](../assets/img/EditInformationDuplicate.png)
- **Edit** the value. Click on **Save** and give a reason,
- The new value is now saved.  The other registration will automatically be updated to **Unique**.

If your SOPs allow it, you can mark the registration as **validated** to confirm the profile has ben reviewed and updated.

- Click on **Actions** on the top right of the profiles you want to confirm,
- Select **Validate**. The registration will now be validated into the program. the beneficiary remain eligible to receive cash aid.

### Decline the PA profile

- Open the profile clicking on **Reg. #** on the left side. You will now see the registration overview.
- Click **Actions** on the top right of the profile you want to decline, ![ActionStatus](../assets/img/ActionsStatusDuplicate.png)
- Select **Decline**. The registration will now be excluded from the program, the beneficiary will not receive any cash aid.
- The other registration will automatically be updated to **Unique**.

If you need to decline multiple registrations, this action will have to be done for each invididual registration.

*Did you accidentally mark a registration as declined? No worries, this is a reversible action. You can always change the status back to **Included**.*

---

### Validate or Include all registrations

Multiple registrations may use the same phone number, as an example. In this case, the duplicates can be ignored if your SOPs allow it.

- Click on **Actions** on the top right of the profiles you want to confirm,
- Select **Include** or **Validate**. The registration will now be included or validated into the program. the beneficiary remain eligible to receive cash aid.

If you need to validate or include multiple registrations, this action will have to be done for each individual registration.

!!! Important "Beware that **Include** and **Validate** are 2 different actions"
    **Validate** is to confirm the profile has been checked into the platform, while **Include** is to finalize the beneficiary inclusion into the program.
    If you have not confirmed your registration list yet, you should mark the registration as **Validated** instead.

### Export deduplication report

- Go to **Registrations** Page,
- On the top right, click on the **Export** button,![Export Button Deduplication](../assets/img/DeduplicationExport.png)
- Open the drop down list and select the export **Duplicate Registrations**,
- The file will be downloaded on your device in the **download folder** as an excel file.

!!! Info "TIP: do not save old duplicate excel record"
    To prevent mistakes and keep personal data secure, excel files should be deleted from your computer once your database is cleaned and updated in 121 platform. This way, you will always have your latest updated list of registered beneficiaries in 121. You are ensure that all beneficiaries data remain secured with deleting exports.
