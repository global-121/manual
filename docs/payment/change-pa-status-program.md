In the course of a program, PA status may change due to a variety of reasons in their inclusion score. You can decide to end or pause the inclusion of a PA within a program. Therefore, the PA may stop receiving payments.

### Search for a PA and Filter on status

In the **Payment** page:

- Click on **Select filter** and select **Quick Search**
- in the search bar, type the PAs details such as the PA#, name, ID or phone number.
- The PA will be listed.

### Change the PA status

In the **Payment** page, you will be able .select different actions to apply to the PA to update their Status to either included, declined, or paused.

- **Included** means the PA has been included in the program by a CVA manager user and can receive Cash Assistance.
- **Declined** means the PA is rejected from the program and will not receive any further Cash Assistance.
- **Pause** means the PA remains included in the program, but the Cash Assistance will be on hold until further notice.


Edit People Affected status in the cash program by clicking on **Choose Action** and Select the appropriate action.

- Then a tick box :material-checkbox-blank-outline: appears on the left of the PA name column.
  - Make an **individual selection** by clicking on the :material-checkbox-outline: on the PA line;
