The Payment page allows you to oversee the payment status for all included beneficiaries in the program and execute payments.

### Process and execute payments to PA

In the 121 Platform, payments can be processed with two different methods:

- **Send and Reconcile manual payments by exporting a payment instructions file**. You pre-process the payment within 121 by including the selected PA in the payment round, then donwload the payment instructions to be sent to the FSP and later reconcile the payment data. Further instructions on [this page](./issue-payment-fsp-portal.md)
- Execute an **instant payment** directly within the 121 Platform. A direct integration to the FSP automates the payment and reconciliation. Further instructions on [this page](./issue-payment-integrated-fsp.md)


### Overview of payment status

In the **Payment** page, you will find the oerview of included beneficiaries in the program. Depending on the program phases, PAs can have different statuses.
The overview is particularly interesting for:

- Finance Manager and Finance Officer to keep track of payment statuses, successful and failed ones.
- Whether CVA Manager and CVA Officer to keep informed and follow wether or not a PA is receiving cash support.
- For donors that may want to view the ongoing payment processes and deadlines as required.

Find out more about the payment and PA statuses on [this page](./list-status-payment-page.md)

### Export payment reports

For **financial audit**, financial and payment reporting for all transactions can be exported as an excel file. You can track and trace any successful and failed payments, and also share the reporting to donors that may require additional information about the running Cash Program.

Find out more about the payment reporting and activity on [this page](./payment-activity-reporting.md)

### Delivery Mechanisms

The 121 Platform enables multipurpose cash. The Platform focuses on **digital cash distribution**, mainly mobile money and bank transfers. If the Financial Service Provider (FSP) supports digital vouchers and/or physical cash distribution, these payment methods can be activated in the 121 Platform.

You will be able to execute payments with one or multiple delivery mechanisms depending on your program settings and enabled payment by the FSP.

!!! info "Integration with local FSP"
    The 121 Platform has integrated with a certain number of local FSP and aggregators. Additional local FSP can be integrated upon evaluation. Please, share your request with our team.

    Not all FSP can be integrated with third tool software such as the 121 Platform. This can be due to lack of compatible technology or for security reasons, which case the bank refuses to integrate with any platform provider so to protect the financial data. Therefore, if you would like to consider integrating your Financial Service Provider with the 121 Platform:

    - Check that your FSP or the bank allow integrating with third party tool or external service provider platform;
    - the FSP or the bank support API protocols. An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other.
