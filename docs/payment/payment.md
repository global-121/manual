### Create new payments

You can create new payments by clicking the **Create new payment** button in the top right corner. This will allow you to start sending cash aid to the beneficiaries included in the program. The 121 Platform offers **two different methods for processing payments**:

- **Send and Reconcile manual payments by exporting a payment instructions file**. You pre-process the payment within 121 by including the selected beneficiary list in the payment round, then download the payment instructions to share to the FSP and later reconcile the payment data. Further instructions on the [manual payment page](./issue-payment-fsp-portal.md) and [manual reconciliation page.](./manual-payment-reconciliation.md)
- Process an **instant payment** directly within the 121 Platform. A direct integration to the FSP automates the payment and reconciliation. Further instructions on [this page](./issue-payment-integrated-fsp.md)


### Overview of payment status

You can view a summary of all payments made in the course of your program and to beneficiaries included in the program. This overview is especially useful for:

- Having clear insights of all disbursements made along the program up to date.
- Finance Manager and Finance Officer to keep track of payment statuses, including successful, pending and failed ones.
- CVA Manager and CVA Officer to keep informed and follow wether or not a beneficiary is receiving cash aid support.
- For donors that may want to view the ongoing payment processes and deadlines as required.

Find out more about the payment and beneficiary's statuses on [this page](./list-status-payment-page.md) ![Payment status](../assets/img/PaymentReportBoard.png)

### Export payment reports

For **financial audit**, financial and payment reporting for all transactions can be exported as an excel file. You can track and trace any successful, pending and failed payments, and also share the reporting to donors that may require additional information about the running Cash Program.

Find out more about the payment reporting and activity on [this page](./payment-reporting.md)

!!! Info "TIPS: Only download excel files when required and delete after exporting / using"
    Excel files should only be downloaded when required to ensure personal data is kept secure. After use, excel files should be deleted from your computer to keep personal data secure and prevent mistakes using old files. This way, you will always have the latest updated data in 121.

### Delivery Mechanisms

The 121 Platform enables multipurpose cash. The Platform focuses on **digital cash distribution**, mainly mobile money, prepaid cards and bank transfers. If your Financial Service Provider (FSP) supports digital vouchers and/or physical cash distribution, these payment methods can be activated in the 121 Platform.

You will be able to process payments with one or multiple delivery mechanisms depending on your program settings and enabled payment by the FSP.

| Category         | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| **FSP Portal**       | For non-integrated FSP and universal cash distribution methods. Manual export of payment instructions to upload into the FSP portal and reconciliation of payment data into 121. |
| **Bank Wire**       | Direct bank transfers issued with 121 platform to beneficiaries (integrated FSP) |
| **VISA debit card**  | Direct transfers and top-up to VISA debit card (integrated FSP). Allows conditional and unconditional modalities. |
| **Mobile money**     | Direct transfers to mobile wallets. |
| **E-vouchers** | This is an electronic document with a specific amount and dates that support and authorize financial transactions at designated locations. These are sent via Whatsapp. |

*In cases physical cash payment may be a better approach, these options can be discussed on a case-by-case basis with our 121 Team.*


!!! info "Integration with local FSP"
    The 121 Platform has integrated with a certain number of local FSP and aggregators. Additional local FSP can be integrated upon evaluation. Please, share your request with our team.

    Not all FSP can be integrated with third tool software such as the 121 Platform. This can be due to **lack of compatible technology** or for **security reasons**, which case the bank refuses to integrate with any platform providers so to protect the financial data. Therefore, if you would like to consider integrating your Financial Service Provider with the 121 Platform:

    - Check that your FSP or the bank allow integrating with third party tool or external service provider platform;
    - the FSP or the bank support API protocols. An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other;
    - Make sure to have an agreement signed regarding the use of their services and data protection.
