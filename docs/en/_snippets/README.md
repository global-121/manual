# Snippets collection

In this folder you can find a collection of snippets that can be used in the documentation.

The format to include a snippet is: (Its a pair of scissors on a line!)

```markdown
## Example snippet

In any Markdon-file you can include a commonly used snippet of text.

-8<- "docs/_snippets/<filename-of-snippet>.md"

```
